the academic and policy debate regarding the role of central banks and financial regulators in addressing climate-related financial risks has rapidly expanded in recent years this perspective presents the key controversies and discusses potential research and policy avenues for the future developing a comprehensive analytical framework to assess the potential impact of climate change and the low-carbon transition on financial stability seems to be the first crucial challenge these enhanced risk measures could then be incorporated in setting financial regulations and implementing the policies of central banks
